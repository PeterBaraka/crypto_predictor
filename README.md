# Bitcoin Price Prediction using LSTM

## Project Overview

This project involves predicting Bitcoin prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The LSTM model is trained on historical Bitcoin price data and uses various engineered features such as moving averages, daily changes, and volatility to make predictions. The goal is to forecast future prices and evaluate the model's performance.
